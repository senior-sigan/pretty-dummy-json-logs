# PDL: Pretty dummy json log Printer

I'm pretty dummy. I need my json logs to look nice.

Other loggers don't work with my json logs format.

So I copy-paste internet and make it go brrr...

Should be compatible  with [Zap Logger](https://github.com/uber-go/zap). But i'm not sure.

## Usage

```shell
./your-programm | pdl
```

## Installation

```shell
go install github.com/senior-sigan/prettylog@latest
```
